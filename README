Ruĝamia is a suite a tools that lets a redmine instance and one or more MUC
(XMPP chatrooms) communicate.
It features:

 - Realtime chatroom notifications when a change occurs in the bugtracker or
   when a commit is pushed on a git repository

 - Request of information about issues present in the bug tracker by sending
   messages in the chatroom

 - Creating new issues in the bug tracker by sending messages in the
   chatroom


It is composed of three distincts parts:

 - A redmine plugin (in ruby) that sends notification messages about the bug
   tracker changes into an IPC socket

 - A git hook (in python) that sends notification messages about recent
   commits into an IPC socket

 - A XMPP bot (in python) that reads messages into an IPC socket and forward
   them into the appropriate chatrooms. It also receives chatroom messages,
   queries the redmine API and sends back a response
