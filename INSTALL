To use ruĝamia you have to follow these (simple) steps.


================
    Git hook
================

* Copy the hooks/pre-receive file into your git’s hooks/ directory

$ cp hooks/pre-receive /home/git/repositories/something.git/hooks


* Edit the values at the top of this file:

- FORGE: The base URL of your forge, without trailing /.

- PROJECT_NAME: the name of the project (as specified in redmine) associated
  with this git repository.

- SOCKET_FILENAME: a filename used for communication through a local
  socket. Specify any file in a repository accessible by the git user,
  redmine and the bot. /tmp/ is a good value if you trust all users having
  access to your machine.

- ROOM_NAME: The JID of the MUC where the bot should announce the new commits.


* Make sure pre-receive is executable

$ chmod +x /home/git/repositories/something.git/hooks


================
    XMPP bot
================

* Create an XMPP account for the bot, or use an existing one.

* start the bot by specifying some values:

python3 bot/bot.py bot@example.com project1@muc.example.com project2@muc.example.com


================
 Redmine Plugin
================

* Copy the redmine_rugamia/ directory into your redmine plugins directory
  (Something like /usr/share/redmine/plugins/)

* Copy config/ruga.example.yml to config/ruga.yml and configure it:
  - socket is the filename of the UNIX socket used to communicate with the
    bot
  - muc_server is the hostname of the MUC server runing the rooms of the
    redmine projects

* Restart redmine
