To use ruĝamia you have to follow these (simple) steps.


================
    Git hook
================

* Copy the hooks/pre-receive file into your git’s hooks/ directory

$ cp hooks/pre-receive /home/git/repositories/something.git/hooks


* Edit the values at the top of this file:

- FORGE: The base URL of your forge, without trailing /.

- PROJECT_NAME: the name of the project (as specified in redmine) associated
  with this git repository.

- IPC_FILENAME: a filename used for communication through IPC. Specify any
  file in a repository accessible by the git user, redmine and the
  bot. /tmp/ is a good value if you trust all users having access to your
  machine.

- ROOM_NAME: The JID of the MUC where the bot should announce the new commits.


* Make sure pre-receive is executable

$ chmod +x /home/git/repositories/something.git/hooks


================
    XMPP bot
================

* Create an XMPP account for the bot, or use an existing one.

* start the bot by specifying some values:

python3 bot/bot.py bot@example.com project1@muc.example.com project2@muc.example.com
